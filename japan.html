            <p>Japan can be overwhelming, at least it was for me. All the neon lights, the massive cities and let's be honest a complety different language that makes you feel even more lost. But with 
                my tips, I will make sure your experience exceeds yours expectations. <br> In order to move around the massive city of Tokyo, your best friend will be a Suica card, or for my irish 
                followers the "japanese leap card". You can get one at any train station and they just cost 5,000 Yen or less than â‚¬3. The Suica card works on a top up basis, and you can do this at the very
                same machine where you bought it. <br>
                Now we can move around, where to go next. In order to inmerse ourself in the real Tokyo vibe, our next stop has to be Shibuya Crossing. Shibuya crossing is described as mind-blowing by everyone who
                has visited it. And they are right! I cannot describe how amazing is to talk around those huge skyscrapes, neonlights, music, poeple dancing... You really feel small. <br>
                After the hectic Tokyo center, you may wanna get some peace. Don't worry I got you, Asakusa temple, in the Ueno district is the perfect place to escape buzzing Tokyo. There you will experience

            <div class="japanpic" style="height:200px;"><img src="assets/images/Unknown.jpg"></div>
            <p>You just got off a long, long, long flight, and what's the first thing that comes to mind...FOOD! I know right. But where to start, Japan has so many options. Well I am here to help you.
            The answer is Ramen, the crown jewel of japanese cusine. You will have so many options, however, bear in mind, Ramen is the japanese equivalent of pizza. What do I mean with that, well 
            toppings are paid separetly. Of you ask just for Ramen, they will bring a plain Ramen, almost no toppings, such as eggs, noriweed, vegetables... Sounds unveliable but it is true. That same thing 
            happen to me on my first night in Tokyo. I ordered ramen and to my dissapointment, almost no toppings, I could not understand why! But a lovely lady seating next to me pointed at the 
            restaurant wall, where all the toppings where listed alongside prices. The more you add, the more the ramen costs. See, just like our pizza. So my tip is always ask for your ramen toppings
            belive me, it will make such a difference.
