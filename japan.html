          <h2>How to spend 10 days in Japan</h2>

          <h5>What to see</h5>

          <p>Wow, you have made it! Congratulations! After a long, long flight you have arrive in Japan. I am sure
            you can't wait to start exploring. For me, what I like to do most when I arrive in Tokyo is to hit the
            streets of Shinjuku. It has the best nightlife in Tokyo, countless restaurants to choose from, arcades,
            shops and much more. Shinjuku is also known for it's Karaoke Restaurants. After a few drinks you
            may feel bold enough to give it a try!<br>
            <div id="jpimg"><img src="assets/images/Unknown-10.jpg"></idv>
            One of the things I would recommend to visit in Tokyo is to visit Asakusa Temple. I see Asakusa
            Temple as a window to the past in Buzzing Tokyo. As spiritual place of peacefulness, surrounded by
            nature and ancient temple structures that will transport you to the Edo period. Please wonder
            around, get lost, and experience this magnificent place. Around the Asakusa Temple there is multiple
            streets where you can have Japanese finger food, and be astonished by it's Edo period architecture.
            Most of the traditional restaurants have been there for generations, so fi you feel a bit adventurous,
            please try one of their delicious meals!<br>
            <div id="jpimg"><img src="assets/images/Unknown-13.jpg"></idv>
            I would not leave Tokyo without visiting it's iconic Tokyo Tower! Or also knows as the Eiffel Tower rip
            off. They do look alike, however, it's all about context isn't it? Tokyo Tower is a massive structure
            designed to uphold the most strong earthquakes. It survive the 2011 Tohoku earthquake! Tokyo
            Towe it is situated in the Rappongi District, and you will see it in front of you as soon as you walk out
            of Rappongi Train Station. I would recommend go at night, they open until 1am, for a better view of
            the city. I went at 11pm and it was absolutely breath-taking! We bought the top roof tickets for €25
            and it was worth every cent of it. The views were just mesmerizing, you could see Tokyo at it's best
            with a 360 panoranmic view.</p><br>

          <h5>Transportation</h5>
          <p>Transportation is one of the main things to organise before a trip, especially if you are travelling to a
            country that does not share your native tong. I know Japan, can feel overwhelming, we all have seen
            the videos of the Tokyo underground system at rush hour. But don’t you worry, I got you! First
            things first, we have arrive at one of the two main airports: Haneda or Narita. If you arrive at Narita
            airport, which is located 1hour and half travel distance from Tokyo city centre you have many
            options to travel to your destination. My favourite is just to use the JR train to Shinjuku. This train
            leaves every 8 minutes and the best part, it is included in you JR Travel Pass, that means, you will not
            have to pay anything there. You can just activate your travel pass at the ticket machine at the
            entrance of the JR Train platform and off you go.<br>
            <div id="jpimg"><img src="assets/images/Unknown-27.jpg"></idv>
            Now you are in Tokyo, and the question is. How to I move around? Well, the Japanese have it all
            figure it out. In every train station there are machines that can be use to purchase a Suica card,
            which is the card you will need to access the Tokyo underground system. The Suica card works on a
            top us basis, and you can top it up at the very machine you bought it. You do not have to calculate
            how long or expensive your journey is going to be, you just tap the card at the entrance of your train
            station and tap again when you exit, the card will calculate the cost of the journey, so you can enjoy
            exploring Tokyo hassle-free.<br>
            <div id="jpimg"><img src="assets/images/Unknown-21.jpg"></idv>
            The third thing you need to know is how to explore Japan beyond Tokyo. This is where the JR Pass
            comes into play. The JR Pass is a train pass exclusive for tourist that you can purchase prior your trip
            on it's official website. They will then post you the JR Pass confirmation that you have to exchange
            when you arrive in Japan in any JR Tickets offices that you will find at all main stations and the
            airport. The JR Pass is posted to you in 24 hours, at least this is how fast mine arrived to Ireland.
            However, I recommend purchasing the pass way in advance in order to avoid any possible delays.
            The travel pass includes all the JR regional trans and the Japanese shinkansen or Bullet Train. With
            this you can safely travel from Tokyo to Osaka with less than three hours!</p><br>

          <h5>Food</h5>
          <p>When you arrive in Japan, you are really spoiled for choice, there are just so many options to chose
            from! The land of the rising sun is well know for it's mouth-watering cuisine, but where to start.<br>
            My first choice when I land in Tokyo is always go for Ramen. I would avoid general chains and look
            for something more authentic. My advise to you is to try Nagi Ramen in Shinjuku. They make a broth
            that is cooked for 12 hours and they have so much toppings to chose from. Nagi Ramen is located in
            Shinjuku District you will find a tiny wooden door and stair that will take to the ramen shop. Please
            be aware, the restaurant is authentic and TINY! Yes, tiny, you may need to be extra careful not to hit
            your head with the ceiling. Like most ramen shops you chose the base of your ramen in a vending
            machine and then add then select the toppings. The machine will tell you a price and then you need
            to insert the money into the machine. A ticket will be printed that you present to the staff, they will
            seat and your order will commence to be prepared. A tip, those machines are exclusively written in
            Japanese, so it would be useful to learn the spelling of your favourite toppings, such as egg or nori
            weed in Japanese as you will have to select them at the machine.<br>
            <div id="jpimg"><img src="assets/images/Unknown.jpg"></idv>
            We are fed now, but what else is there to try. Well sushi, of course! Sushi in Japan is all about quality
            and craftsmanship. Every single piece of sushi is prepared to perfection. Please note that Japanese
            way of eating sushi is different from the west. The wasabi will be on the sushi piece already, so you
            should not ask for wasabi. Then you dip your piece, fish first, not the rice part and ENJOY!<br>
            <div id="jpimg"><img src="assets/images/IMG-9380.jpg"></idv>
            Japanese cuisine is well known for eating raw food and this can cause some problems especially if
            you come from Europe. I will advise you of a meal you should not order if you are not an
            adventurous person, and this is Oyakodon. This meal is rice, served with 5 seconds cooked chicken
            that has been placed after it's quick cooking time to a bowl with cold water to stop it from cooking
            further. The chicken is almost raw and you can see when it's presented to you. I have to saw that
            safety standards in Japan are very high, and the chickens used for this dish have been especially
            raised and treated. However, if you are not up for a surprise I would not recommend to try this dish.</p><br>
