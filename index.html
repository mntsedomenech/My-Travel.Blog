            <p>Hello! Welcome to my personal travel blog. As far as I can remember, travelling has always been my passion. First I started 
                only travelling on holidays like all of you, but that was not enough time to discover this wonderful world. So I quit my job 
                and with effort and determination I became a full time travel blogger. I am not gonna lie, it was a big change from being a 
                lawyer to become a full time travel content creater, however, this is a life change that I do not regret. <br>
                I am so grateful for this community that we have build, and if you are new, please feel free to tag along! </p>
